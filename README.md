# MovieDbApp

<ul>
<li><b>1. Project Description</b> </li>
The application works by listing the movies with the API provided by themoviedb.com. Movies are listed in tabs. Each movie can be added to favorites by clicking on the star in the top right corner of the detail page.
<li><b>2. Project Architecture</b></li>
Mvc was chosen as software architecture. Because it is easier to use the data coming from every api connection.
<li><b>If I had more time ?</b></li>
 I would make Adapter classes generic.
</ul>
